# Traffic sign detection

The following project has as an objective to build a Neural Network capable of properly classify different traffic signs, for this project we will use the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark available at the following link: https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html.

# Dataset

The dataset is divided on the training set and the testing set, with the training set containing 39209 pictures and the test set 12630 pictures, roughly a 75-25 ratio. There are also 43 different classes to which each image can belong to.
